                <p class=" wow animate__animated animate__zoomIn">Albert Einstein (German: Albert Einstein) (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955) was a German-born physicist (later relinquished German citizenship), Swiss and American, of Jewish parents, known as the father of relativity as the author of the famous theories of special and general relativity, which were the first building block of modern theoretical physics. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for a research paper on the photoelectric effect, among three hundred other scientific papers on the equivalence of matter and energy (E=mc²), quantum mechanics, and others. His proven conclusions led to the explanation of many scientific phenomena that classical physics failed to prove. He began his journey with relativity with "special relativity", which contradicted Newton's theory of time and space to solve in particular the problems of the old theory regarding electromagnetic waves in general, and light in particular, between (1902 - 1909) in Switzerland. General relativity was introduced in 1915, in which he discussed gravity, and is the current description of gravity in modern physics. General relativity generalizes both special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation by providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or what is called spacetime. Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, renouncing his German citizenship (as a citizen of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. Einstein lived in Switzerland from 1895 to 1914, except for one year in Prague, and received his academic diploma from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in 1900. He obtained Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life after living stateless for more than five years. In 1905, he received his doctorate from the University of Zurich. In the same year he published four groundbreaking papers (the "miracle year") that brought him to the academic world at the age of 26. Einstein taught theoretical physics in Zurich from 1912 to 1914 before leaving for Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power, and because of his Jewish background he never returned to Germany. He settled in the United States and became a U.S. citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II he signed a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt warning him of the possible development of "atomic bombs" and recommending that the United States begin similar research, which eventually led to the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported the Allied powers, but generally denounced the idea of ​​using nuclear fission as a weapon. He signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell, which highlighted the dangers of nuclear weapons. Einstein worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey until his death in 1955.</p>
