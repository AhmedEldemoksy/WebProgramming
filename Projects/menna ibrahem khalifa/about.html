        <div class="grid-item text1"><p>Experimental evidence for the atomic theory

            In 1827, <br> the scientist Robert Brown observed pollen grains in water under a microscope and found that they moved through the water, but he could not determine the mechanism by which this movement occurred. In 1905, Einstein presented a research paper on the random movement of particles in liquids, which became known as Brownian motion.
            
            Einstein explained in great detail this movement that Brown observed on the grains, which is carried out by water molecules. Although atoms and molecules were discovered by other scientists, Einstein's explanation of Brownian motion is conclusive evidence of their existence.</p></div>
        <div class="grid-item text2"><p>Theory of General Relativity: <br>

            In 1916, Einstein published the theory of general relativity, which is a generalization of the theory of special relativity and Newton's law of gravity using a unified concept of gravity as a geometric property of time and space, or what is called spacetime.
            
            General relativity has contributed extensively to determining the shape of the universe, and its predictions have been proven by various practical experiments. It was the basis for explaining astronomical phenomena such as black holes and gravitational lensing.</p></div>

        <div class="grid-item text3"><p>The famous equation for the concept of static energy: <br>

            In connection with Einstein's special theory, Einstein predicted the equation of energy and mass through his famous equation (E=MC2), where C expresses the speed of light in a vacuum.
            
            The importance of this theory is highlighted because it showed that every body has static energy that is different from its kinetic and potential energy, and it included that gravity has the ability to bend light and it can also be used to calculate the energy released and used in nuclear reactions.</p></div>
        <div class="grid-item text4"><p>Special Relativity: <br> The incompatibility of Newtonian mechanics with Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism led Einstein to write his paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. Einstein proposed changes in the concepts of the motion of bodies when dealing with bodies moving at a speed close to the speed of light. This was later known as the special theory of relativity, which was later proven experimentally and gained worldwide acceptance. At present, the special theory is considered the most accurate explanation of the motion of bodies at any speed.</p></div>
